1. SNC (Sub Numa Cluster)
2. UPI Optimizations (Ultra Path Interconnect Optimizations)


summary:
   skylake:  14nm (tock-tick)
   broadwell:22nm (tock-tick)
1. SNC (Sub Numa Cluster)
   1. divide one node 2 nodes as numa cluster

2. UPI Optimizations (Ultra Path Interconnect Optimizations)
   QPI (Quick Path Interconnect)
   since Skylake, it was used.
   1) Max bindwith 
      UPI(10.4 T/S)  > QPI(9.6 T/S)
   2) transfer rate
      UPI(25%)  > QPI(4%)
   3) idle power
      UPI(25%)  < QPI (50%)
