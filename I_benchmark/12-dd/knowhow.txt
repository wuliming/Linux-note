summary
- option
- read & write 

1) option
 - if    read from instead of stdin (usually set /dev/zero)
 - of    write to instead of stdout (usually set /dev/null to test the disk performance)
 - bs    block size # default block size: 512Byte
 - count block count
 - conv  sync / fsync / fdatasync
 - iflag sync / dsync / direct / cio / nocache / nonblock
 - oflag sync / dsync / direct / cio / nocache / nonblock

 note1: dsync vs sync vs fsync
   fsync > dsync > sync ( if want write data to disk ,you can add conv=fsync)
 1. dsync (kw. each write) 
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=test_file bs=1k count=10 oflag=dsync
    10240 bytes (10 kB) copied, 0.118226 s, 86.6 kB/s

  Use synchronized I/O for data. For the output file, 
  this forces a physical write of output data on each write. 
  For the input file, this flag can matter when reading 
  from a remote file that has been written to synchronously by some other process. 
  Metadata (e.g., last-access and last-modified time) is not necessarily synchronized. 
 2. sync (kw. like dsync + metadata)
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=test_file bs=1k count=10 oflag=sync
    10240 bytes (10 kB) copied, 0.123513 s, 82.9 kB/s

  likewise, but also for metadata
 3. fsync (kw. sync at the end time)
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=test_file bs=1k count=10 conv=fsync
   10240 bytes (10 kB) copied, 0.0146487 s, 699 kB/s

  Synchronize output data and metadata just before finishing. 
  This forces a physical write of output data and metadata

 note 2: other iflag/oflag
 1. nocache
  Request to discard the system data cache for a file.
  When count=0 all cached data for the file is specified,
  otherwise the cache is dropped for the processed portion of the file.
  Also when count=0, failure to discard the cache is
  diagnosed and reflected in the exit status.

  Note data that is not already persisted to storage
  will not be discarded from cache, so note the use of the sync options
  in the examples below, which are used to maximize the effectiveness of the nocache flag.

  Here are some usage examples:

  # Advise to drop cache for whole file
  dd if=ifile iflag=nocache count=0
  
  # Ensure drop cache for the whole file
  dd of=ofile oflag=nocache conv=notrunc,fdatasync count=0
  
  # Drop cache for part of file
  dd if=ifile iflag=nocache skip=10 count=10 of=/dev/null

 2. append
  Write in append mode, so that even if some other process is writing to this file,
  every dd write will append to the current contents of the file. 
  This flag makes sense only for output. If you combine this flag with the of=file operand,
  you should also specify conv=notrunc unless you want the output file to be 
  truncated before being appended to.

 3. cio
  Use concurrent I/O mode for data. This mode performs direct I/O 
  and drops the POSIX requirement to serialize all I/O to the same file.
  A file cannot be opened in CIO mode and with a standard open at the same time.

 4. direct (kw: multiple of 512Byte)
  Use direct I/O for data, avoiding the buffer cache.
  Note that the kernel may impose restrictions on read or write buffer sizes.
  For example, with an ext4 destination file system and a Linux-based kernel, 
  using oflag=direct  will cause writes to fail with EINVAL if the output
  buffer size is not a multiple of 512.

 5. nonblock
  Use non-blocking I/O.

2) read and write
  1. read
  # dd if=test_file of=/dev/null bs=102M count=3

  2. write
  # dd if=/dev/zero of=test_file bs=102M count=3
