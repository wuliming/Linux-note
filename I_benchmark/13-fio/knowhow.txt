1. schema
  - io type
  1) read		Sequential reads.
  2) write.		Sequential writes.
  3) rw,readwrite.	Sequential mixed reads and writes.
  4) randread		Random reads.
  5) randwrite		Random writes.

  - io Engine
  1) libaio		asynchronous IO
  2) sync		synchronous IO	

  - direct (default: 0)
  1) 0			buffer IO
  2) 1			driect IO (without pagecache)

2. usage
  *  when test buffer
    - in order to avoid data instability need to clean memory buffer by "sync"
      # sync
      # echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 
  
    - the filesize need to less than `cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio` * `free memory`
