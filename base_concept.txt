  1) SATA stands for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment 
     and SAS stands for Serial Attached SCSI 
     (SCSI Stands for Small Computer System Interface, typically pronounced as scuzzy).
     They are two types of interface used for transferring data to and from hard drives.
  2) speed
     SATA:	7.2K
     SAS :	10K and 15K
